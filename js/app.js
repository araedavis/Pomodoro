$(document).ready(function() {
  

  /* $('#timer').html(timerHTML); //this renders the minutes and seconds as properly formatted HTML */
    

 


    
 
});

//so the pause button works, although the paused time needs to be formatted. BUT how to prevent the interval from then resetting? Tried adding toggle classes - didn't help.
